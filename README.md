# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for the Myopia Clusters project, which explores the possibility of using unsupervised learning to identify distinct groups of patients with nearsightedness. The project involves data processing, dimensionality reduction with PCA and t-SNE, cluster analysis with K-means, and visualization of the results.

## Files
The following files are included in this project:

- myopia.csv: Raw data file containing patient data
- Myopia Clusters.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code used to analyze the data and generate the results
- README.md: This file

## Usage
To run the analysis, open Myopia Clusters.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. All necessary dependencies are listed in the first cell of the notebook.

## Results
The analysis produces a scatter plot of the t-SNE output and an elbow plot to identify the best number of clusters. Based on the findings, a brief recommendation is provided.

## Conclusion
The Myopia Clusters project explores the possibility of using unsupervised learning to identify distinct groups of patients with nearsightedness. The project demonstrates the use of various machine learning techniques such as data processing, dimensionality reduction, and cluster analysis.
